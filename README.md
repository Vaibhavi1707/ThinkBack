# ThinkBack
A transcription and summarization tool for hybrid classes. 

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The raging pandemic has taught us that the Indian classrooms need a desperate shift in their
perspectives of how information and knowledge are relayed to the students. It has brought on the
implementation of a hybrid system of education where some of the students attend live classes
while others do the same online. We require some solution that promotes concentration and
participation in the classroom along with a platform for automatic note taking.

Our solution caters to the problem of Future of learning - Hybrid Education (the second one out
of the given problem statements).

Upon taking the problems listed above into consideration, we plan to solve them using our
platform and make it easier for students to take notes. As soon as a class begins, the recording will
start automatically through the chrome extension. After this step, text extraction will be done
using symbl.ai. It will also simultaneously extract/recognize deadlines and questions from the
transcript and prepare a final presentable pdf document. This will be uploaded onto the AWS
cloud server and any student that logs into that specific institute cloud can access the required
notes for his/her educational purposes.

Students aren’t often able to participate in the class as they are busy with note taking.
Transcription of the class removes the need for writing notes during the class. This would help
students focus more in the class and also participate more in the class activities and discussions.
It promotes collaborative learning.

Generally, hybrid classes are recorded by the platform on which the class is held. However, during
hybrid classes, if the instructor moves around the class like how they are used to during the live
offline mode, the people attending the classes online often get no or very low audio in the video recording. Transcription ensures that everyone in the class has access to the same notes and same content and nobody misses out on anything.

Also, what we have observed is that instructors often do not wish to video record their classes
because students tend to bunk classes and watch said recordings later. The method of
transcription ‘technically’ records the class while making the students participate in the class
discussions.
